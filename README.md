# Title: End-to-End Testing with Python in Robot-Framework


Introduction:
This documentation provides a guide for setting up and running end-to-end tests using Robot Framework with Python


## Setting up the Project in IntelliJ IDEA:
1. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org.

2. Install IntelliJ IDEA from JetBrains.

3. Install the Python plugin in IntelliJ IDEA if it's not already installed.

4. Install Additional Libraries (if needed): Install Additional Libraries (if needed):

5. Install Python and pip: python -m pip install --upgrade pip

6. Create a Virtual Environment: python -m venv robot-env

7. Install Robot Framework: pip install robotframework

8. Install Additional Libraries (if needed): Install Additional Libraries (if needed):


## Running the Tests:
Once the project is set up, you can run the tests using the following steps:

1. You can run the test from the terminal within IntelliJ -robot -d logs tests
   
2. Run All Tests: To run all tests, navigate to the test class containing the test suite. Right-click on the class name and select "Run" to execute all tests within that class.


## Conclusion:
Following these steps, you will have a Robot Framework project set up with Python using IntelliJ IDEA, ready for creating and running test cases.
